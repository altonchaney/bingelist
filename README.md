BingeList
==================
A service for curating and easily viewing required episode lists for TV shows, cutting down binge watching and catching up dramatically.

Created with the help of these tools
------------
- Jade (http://jade-lang.com/), a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node and browsers.
- LESS (http://lesscss.org/), a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques.
- Angular (https://angularjs.org/), a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
